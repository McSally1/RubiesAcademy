<h1>Our History</h1>
<div class="def">  
<p>Rubies Academy started in 2012 as a creche caring for babies within the ages of 6 months to 3 years. Amazingly, the school commenced the Nursery and Primary section in September 2013. The school is a fast growing one aimed at nurturing leaders that will positively transform our society. It does this through inculcating principles such as diligence, hard work, confidence, godliness and respect. Our Rubies as they are called are taught using play way, practical and visual methods, thus resulting in their improved performance. They enjoy a rich blend of Nigerian and foreign based curriculum. Subjects taught and learnt include all the traditional subjects as well as French, Music, Phonics and Ballet. Our Rubies are smart, creative, intelligent and are motivated to be the best. Our Rubies soar high in the various common entrance examinations they sit for. One of rubies came out tops in the federal common entrance examinations in Rivers state. We have three sections, Nursery, Primary and Secondary Sections. The Nursery section comprises of Creche, Wobblers, Toddlers, Nursery 1 & 2. The Primary section comprises of Year 1 to 5 classes, while the Secondary section comprises of Year 7 to 12 classes. The rapid increase in the number of Rubies have necessitated the expansion of the school building to ensure the vision of providing a conducive and comfortable learning environment is not violated. The new building houses more classrooms, computer lab, auditorium, ballet studios and offices. Our teachers are highly qualified and experienced. They are God fearing and committed to the vision of nurturing jewels. They are constantly challenged to bring out the best in our Rubies. Our daily prayer for our Rubies is that they grow up to become pace setters and trail-blazers. Truly, God is faithful. Barr. (Mrs.) O.N.P Adiela.
